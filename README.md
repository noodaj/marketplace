# Project T3 App

This is a full-stack project done with the T3 stack using all of the technologies provided. </br>

## Getting Started
<p>
Install the dependencies required and set up a sqlite database. If you would like to have a administrator account, you must create that in the database itself. </br>
You will also have to set up a default user account so that items stored if you aren't signed in. This is to hold all the items a user has in their cart. (This could've been solved with local storage but I was lazy.)</br>
</p>
<p>
From there you can access the administrator page using the dropdown icon once you sign in. You can then as many items as you wish into your inventory. Play around with it and have fun.
