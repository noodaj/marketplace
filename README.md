# Project T3 App

This is a full-stack project done with the T3 stack using all of the technologies provided. </br>
<p>
Install the dependencies required and set up a sqlite database. If you would like to have a administrator account, you must create that in the database itself. From there you can access the administrator page using the dropdown icon once you sign in. You can then as many items as you wish into your inventory. Play around with it and have fun.
